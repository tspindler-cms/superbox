Enhancing html files of FOF7 

This is a sample project to get familiar with nodejs and jquery. The usfl designation comes from
the FOF7 online league I participate in.

The base for the project are the html files generated by the FOF7 football game. The game files
can be exported as csv and are stored in mongodb. The actual game results and statistics can
be exported as html from FOF7. The goal of the project is to connect the two and for example
give an overview of a player that one finds in a box score file.

The base technologies on the server side used are express, monk, mongodb driver and jade. The
frontend uses jquery.

First the dependencies for node (and node itself) need to be installed. For that the usfl/package.json
is used as a base, calling npm install from the usfl directory will install the needed node
modules.

The express app itself resides in the usfl directory. The routes/index.js contains the needed
routes to connect the league html files with the usfl view. After starting the server (npm start in
the usfl directory), the league files can be reached via http://localhost:3000/usfl/ When navigating
to a box score file, some javascript will be injected and when a player gets clicked on, a brief
overview is shown in a popup window.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- the scoring summary contains many player names and only one gets shown in the overview
- stats with a score of 0 are ignored, albeit they may be part of a players stat set
