The game files\r\ncan be exported as csv and are stored in mongodb. The actual game results and statistics can\r\nbe exported as html from FOF7. The goal of the project is to connect the two and for example\r\ngive an overview of a player that one finds in a box score file.\r\n\r\n### Javascript nodejs express server ###\r\n\r\nThe base technologies on the server side used are express, monk, mongodb driver and jade. The\r\nfrontend uses jquery. \r\n\r\nFirst the dependencies for node (and node itself) need to be installed. For that the usfl/package.json\r\nis used as a base, calling npm install from the usfl directory will install the needed node\r\nmodules.\r\n\r\nThe express app itself resides in the usfl directory. The routes/index.js contains the needed\r\nroutes to connect the league html files with the usfl view. After starting the server (npm start in\r\nthe usfl directory), the league files can be reached via http://localhost:3000/usfl/ When navigating\r\nto a box score file, some javascript will be injected and when a player gets clicked on, a brief\r\noverview is shown in a popup window.\r\n\r\n### Java 8 import scripts ###\r\n\r\nThe files for creating the mongodb based on the csv export reside in import. This is work in progress.\r\nFor now you need to build the jars with ant and ivy:\r\n\r\n  *ant runjar*\r\n\r\nThe config file can be supplied with\r\n\r\n  *--file=config.yml*\r\n\r\nNote that currently only the update class is defined in the jar. For accessing other classes you\r\nneed to work with the classpath of the jar.\r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUES:\r\n- the scoring summary contains many player names and only one gets shown in the overview\r\n- stats with a score of 0 are ignored, albeit they may be part of a players stat set\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
